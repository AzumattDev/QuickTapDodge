# Description

## A simple mod that allows you to quickly tap the directional keys to dodge in that direction. Also allows for dodge canceling via jumping. Optionally make spacebar jump while crouched instead of dodge, or do nothing at all.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

### Mod made at the request of NorgerLegacy (norgerlegacy) in discord.
